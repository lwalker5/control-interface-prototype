//README for Control Interface - Lindsay Walker
//Interactive Web App

Paramount Plastics, a vacuum forming plastic company located in Northern Indiana, was in need of a new control interface for one of their machines. To eliminate problems of readability, ease worker stress, and improve productivity, my web design class explored an iPad interface. We first visited the company to gather research and then made interactive web app prototypes to present to workers that would potentially use the machines. This is my take on an interface redesign for iPad. The white on dark improves readability and the streamlined process eliminates unnecessary steps and chances of error.
